# Jack-Musical-App
I am making a musical app for an artist in December that I am going to see. I will be keeping the app simple and it will be a wordle twist but with song titles.
I've added extra, once the word has been guessed, the song will play after. Not sure if it will go to youtube video or personal play list!
I will have the guessed word go to Youtube video/s. I have 6 songs but I think it might be best to go to ten. Depends on how easy it will be to add the Youtube link and timing of the APP.
